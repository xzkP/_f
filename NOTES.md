# GAME NOTES/IDEAS:

## 2D PIXEL ART GAME
- Occurs on an "abandoned" island in the middle of nowhere
- An explorer in stranded, and in the hopes of surviving attempts to find lost life --> (unbeknownst to him, all residents of the island have been killed by disease)
- PLOT LINE:
	- Explorer (MC) wakes up on a seemingly abandoned island 
		- flashbacks to right before passing out --> a map is dropped on his chest by an unseen individual
		- looks around for the individual, but they're no where to be found
	- Needs food & weapons:
		- Reaches an abandoned village/civilization far from the starting point 
			- Fights smaller scaled mobs on the way --> once he reaches a "castle" the first boss appears
		- BOSS FIGHT: defeating the boss lets him subdue & harness the spirits of the dead --> needed for the final boss maybe?
		- After killing the first boss, they tell him that there exists a way out of the island --> a forge that contains a fighter plane
	- Adventure towards the fighter plane --> (actually the lair of the evil scientist):

## MOBS
- zombies
- cyborgs? --> automated by the evil scientist
- ghosts? --> evil spirits
- bosses [3]:
	- 1: zombie king --> spawn created by the scientist
	- 2: spirits of the undead --> spirit of the past king of the island
	- 3: evil scientist --> inflictor of the disease and creator of the mobs 

## IDEAS
- Transition from a projected 3D look to a pure 2D look for some "boss fights"
- During boss fights, the explorer enters a stadium and fights in 2D (like ssb)
