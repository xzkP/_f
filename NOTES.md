# MAJOR RECONSTRUCTION OF THE CODE WAS DONE
Everything changed to a SMB-type 2-player game. It's probably more interactive that way (and easier to program).

## TODO:
- Implement audio --> first find the audio files.
- Add torches so the background doesn't seem to boring (maybe learn how lighting works)
- Optimization & Refactoring (DO THIS ONLY IF YOU HAVE TIME)
